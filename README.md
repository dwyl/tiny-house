Research repo for capturing everything 
we learn while designing & building 
our Tiny Home on Wheels.


# Why?

Young people entering the workforce in major cities
face a grim reality: 
they cannot afford to buy/own their own 1 bed apartment
unless they have rich parents, inherit money,
or win the lottery [work in tech] ...

Affordable housing needs to be 
a strategic priority at a macro level.
Politicians and goverments need to 
fast track legislation that helps 
young people _buy_ their own place.


We need to lead the way by doing the following:

1. **Research** everything we can find on **_existing_ tiny houses**
2. **Design** a tiny house from first principals; 
   i.e: every aspect from the trailer to the roof.
3. **_Build_** at least 1 unit with our own hands and capture the process/learning.
4. **Open Source _everything_** we learn along the way.
5. **Open** our **Workshop** to people wanting to build their own Tiny House.

# What?

For now this repo will contain all of our research in
[tiny-house/**issues**](https://github.com/nelsonic/tiny-house/issues).
We need to collect as much as possible
and then sort/filter what we love 
vs. what we want to avoid.

## Off-grid Ultra-low Carbon Footprint

Research all building materials,
technologies and best practices
for building Tiny Homes with the 
lowest possible initial Carbon Footprint 
and ongoing environmental impact.

We are planning to use as much 
renewable/sustainable wood,
cork and hemp as possible. 

**`TODO`**: Research suppliers for these materials!


## Observation: Existing Tiny House Builders _Very_ Maual


We have visited 3 tiny house builders in-person
in the last month. 
[**`#20`**](https://github.com/dwyl/tiny-house/issues/20),
[**`#25`**](https://github.com/dwyl/tiny-house/issues/25) 
&
[**`#25`**](https://github.com/dwyl/tiny-house/issues/26)
They have all been great eye-opening experiences.
One thing they all share in-common is that they 
are very manual in their construction techniques.
i.e. traditional carpentry with wood beams 
and screws.
Relying on labour (humans)
to do all the cutting, joinng & assembly.

> **Note**: There are a few tiny house builders 
> in _other_ countries 
> e.g: US, Netherlalands & Nordics,
that are using more modern manufacturing techniques
including **`CNC`** and **`3D Printing`**.
But these are all **VC-funded**
i.e. they are building houses to sell to middle-income
families typically as "Accessory Dwelling Units" ("ADUs")
and in the process make Rich People _even_ Richer. 
_Anything_ VC-funded means
they expect disproportional returns on investment.
If they put in **`$1M`** they expect **`$10M`** back.
This fine in shiny toy distraction Apps
but not great for housing affordability. 


## CAD/CAM


Use Modern Computer-aided Design & Manufacturing
to dramatically lower the cost and lead time
in making a Tiny House from scratch
including all the furniture.

# _Who?_ 👪



# How?

Please: 
1. Read the _existing_ 
[tiny-house/**issues**](https://github.com/nelsonic/tiny-house/issues)
and share your thoughts as comments. 🔍 💬 🙏
2. Open **`new`** issues with anything you discover!

Right now we are focussed on collecting as much info as we can.
We can curate/cull later.


# Tiny House Specification
