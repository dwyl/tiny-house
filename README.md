Research repo for capturing everything 
we learn while designing & building 
our Tiny Home on Wheels.


# Why?

Young people entering the workforce in major cities
face a grim reality: 
they cannot afford to buy/own their own 1 bed apartment
unless they have rich parents or inherit money,

Affordable housing needs to be a strategic priority at a macro level.
Politicians and goverments need to 

We need to lead the way by:

1. **Research** everything we can find on **_existing_ tiny houses**
2. **Design** a tiny house from first principals.
3. **_Build_** at least 1 unit with our own hands and capture the process/learning.
4. **Open Source _everything_** we learn along the way.
5. **Open** our **Workshop** to people wanting to build their own Tiny House.

# What?

For now this repo will contain all of our research in
[tiny-house/**issues**](https://github.com/nelsonic/tiny-house/issues).
We need to collect as much as possible
and then sort/filter what we love 
vs. what we want to avoid.

## Off-grid Ultra-low Carbon Footprint

Research all building materials,
technologies and best practices
for building Tiny Homes with the 
lowest possible Carbon Footprint.


# How?

Please: 
1. Read the _existing_ 
[tiny-house/**issues**](https://github.com/nelsonic/tiny-house/issues)
and share your thoughts as comments. üîç üí¨ üôè
2. Open **`new`** issues with anything you discover!

Right now we are focussed on collecting as much info as we can.
We can curate/cull later.
